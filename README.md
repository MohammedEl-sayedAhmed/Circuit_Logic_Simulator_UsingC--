# Circuit_Logic_Simulator_UsingC++
 You are required to implement a simple logic circuit designer/simulator. Your implementation
should be in C++ code. You must use object oriented programming to implement this application.
Your application should help users draw a logic circuit using different components, connect them
with connections, add switches to control inputs and LEDs to monitor outputs, and simulate the
circuit operation. The application should accept input from the user as mouse clicks or key strokes
and then take actions according to the input
